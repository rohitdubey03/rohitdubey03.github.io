									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/about1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am currently pursuing my B. Tech in Computer Science Engineering. I have a long-standing interest in Research and Development in Data Science. I hope to build my future career in the IT sector and any chance to sharpen my abilities or knowledge of this industry would be extremely helpful. I have been working on various projects on Data Science. I like to read, I like to write. I like to think, I like to dream. I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night. I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.I like delicious food and comfortable shoes. I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.<br></p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/about2.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was first introduced to C/C++ programming when I was 15 years old. I was introduced to the key features of the language and realized that it is just an improvement over Logic and Mathematics which can be fed to a machine. At first, I didn't understand why I needed to learn that. My dad then told me that today's world runs on these codes written by people like you and I. My first C++ project was “Core Banking”, which helped me grow as a programmer. I became more confident, efficient, and overall better. When I joined college in 2017, one of my professors recommended me Python and since then I have loved it. 
										In my 4th semester of college, I had databases as a subject wherein I learnt about Oracle, NoSQL, MySQL, which helped me and motivated me about databases. 
										Web Applications has always been something that fascinated me as a kid, so as soon as I joined college, I learnt HTML/CSS and to top it off I learnt JavaScript as well. In my 4th semester of college, I had Computer Networks and Operating System as subjects and there I started learning more about LINUX, Windows, Network which made me more comfortable using these in real life.
										In my first year of college, I learnt about Differential Equations, Numerical Mathematics and Probability theory which has helped me a lot in programming. I have always been a machine learning enthusiast, hence I learned Linear Algebra and it boosted my confidence about Machine Learning.
