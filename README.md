### About Me:


I am currently pursuing my B. Tech in Computer Science Engineering. 
I have a long-standing interest in Research and Development in Data Science. 
I hope to build my future career in the IT sector and any chance to sharpen my abilities or knowledge of this industry would be extremely helpful. I have been working on 
various projects on Data Science. I like to read, I like to write. 
I like to think, I like to dream. I like to talk, I like to listen.
I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night.
I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.
I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when 
I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.I like delicious food and comfortable shoes. 
I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
